### Who am I?

My name is Will, and am currently residing in Charleston, SC with my best friend and spotted companion - Doobie.

## What am I working on?

I am a full-stack software engineer, comfortable with all things TypeScript. Most of my projects are behind closed doors, but I would love to answer any questions that you may have!
