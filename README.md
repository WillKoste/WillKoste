### Who am I?

My name is Will, and I hail from Charleston, SC.

I am a full-stack software engineer, comfortable with all things TypeScript. Most of the repos that I contribute to on Github are private, but I would love to answer any questions that you may have! You can reach me at `willkoste@gmail.com`.
