### Who am I?

My name is Will, and am currently residing in Charleston, SC with my best friend who also happens to be a dalmatian- Doobie.

## What am I working on?

I am a full-stack MERN/PERN developer looking to make something great for the industry. I would like to use Github as an opportunity to practice collaborating with others, meet new people, and to gain experience in the field.
